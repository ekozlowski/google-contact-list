# google-contact-list
Contact List management with Google's API via GET / POST requests

# Synopsis

I needed something to let me manage my wife's Google contact list programatically after her gmail account was compromised.  This is the result.

# What This Needs To Work

You'll need to generate a oauth 2 token and put the token into config.py's 'auth_token' section.  (Paste it in over the REDACTED section).

You can generate Oauth2 tokens that work here:  https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/

# What this won't do

Generate your tokens for you.  (yet)

# Disclaimers

I've not used this anywhere other than personal use.  If you have any questions, feel free to email me at ekozlowski1 at gmail dot com.
